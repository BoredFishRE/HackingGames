# Hacking CoolMathGames
Why do productive things when you can hack coolmathgames?
My goal is to hack as many games on the mobile CoolMathGames.
MOBILE ONLY.
I hate flash, and I hope it stays dead forever.

Anyways, most of my hacks edit the save file, so if it clears some data, don't get mad.

I mostly hack currency, or saved values.
Stuff like levels, XP, lives, money, or anything that's saved. That means no arcade games.

Maybe once in a while I'll make an exception.

## WTF how do you even use this
